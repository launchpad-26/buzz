"""Step 8 control: the attempt must be visible in the published review.

The clause that carries the weight is the delimiter-breakout one. For plain-English
payloads escape(payload) == payload, so "quotes the payload in post-escape form" is
trivially satisfied by a renderer that echoed the raw source field and never saw the
contained form. The breakout payload is the only one where the two representations
diverge, so it is the only case that can tell a contained render from a bypassed one.
