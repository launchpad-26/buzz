"""The 35-case control suite: every payload through every entry point.

Each control asserts the payload appears **only inside a data block**, never in a
position a reader would take as instruction. That assertion rests on the envelope, so it
fails the moment containment is removed — which is what step 9 measures.

Cases whose payload carries an unambiguous tell additionally assert a finding. The rest
are enumerated by id as the model layer's responsibility (#117). Naming the gap is the
point: a suite that silently covered 28 of 35 while reporting "all pass" would be the
coverage theatre this issue exists to prevent.
