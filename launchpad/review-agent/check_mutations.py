"""Mutation harness: break containment on purpose, and require the suite to notice.

**Why this exists.** The original mutation control flipped one seam — `enabled=False`,
which removes the envelope wholesale — and passing it was read as "the controls fail if
containment is removed". An independent review disproved that: deleting the *escaping*
from `contain()` while leaving the envelope intact passed every control, including the
mutation control itself. One removal had been tested and the result generalised.

So the seam is now one mutant among several. Each mutation below is a plausible
regression a future edit could introduce; each must be caught by at least one control,
and the harness names which one caught it. A mutation nothing catches is a hole in the
suite, reported as a failure here rather than discovered by an attacker.

Mutations are applied to a scratch copy. The repository is never modified.
