"""Containment for pull-request-authored text.

Implements launchpad-26/buzz#120. The normative contract is CONTAINMENT.md in this
directory; this module is that document made executable. Where the two disagree, the
document wins and this file is the bug.

Author-controlled text is wrapped in a block whose closing marker carries a per-run
nonce, so an attacker who knows the format still cannot forge a boundary. Escaping is
applied underneath as a second layer, because a nonce can leak and one leak must not be
a full bypass.
