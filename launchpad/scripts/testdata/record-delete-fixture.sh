# Manufacture the one fixture that has no real source: a pull request that
# DELETES the nearest rules file for a path it also touches.
#
# Why this exists. Nearest-rules resolution must read the PR's head tree, not the
# local worktree — and the direction that proves it is deletion. No PR in this
# fork's history deletes a rules file, and none was found upstream, so the add
# case (PR 14, real) would otherwise have to stand in for both by assertion. It
# does not: a resolver that reads the local checkout passes the add case and
# fails this one.
#
# What it does to the world: pushes a branch, opens a PR against launchpad,
# records two responses, then closes the PR unmerged and deletes the branch.
# Nothing is merged. The PR number is left in delete-pr.number so record.sh can
# read the responses without ever opening a PR itself.
#
# Usage: launchpad/scripts/testdata/record-delete-fixture.sh
