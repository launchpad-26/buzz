# this to re-record after an API change, and read the diff.
#
# Two fixtures are projections rather than whole responses, because the whole
# response is megabytes of noise. Each projection keeps every key of every entry
# it keeps — the shape is untouched, only irrelevant entries are dropped, and the
# jq filter that did it is right here:
#   pr86-tree.json        4337 entries -> the 120 *.md entries    (1.1 MB -> 30 KB)
#   tree-truncated.json   71798 entries -> the first 20 entries   (11 MB -> 4 KB)
# Nothing in the pre-flight reads a non-markdown tree entry, and the truncated
# fixture exists for its `truncated: true` flag alone.
