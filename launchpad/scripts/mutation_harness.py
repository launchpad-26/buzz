"""Break the pre-flight on purpose, and require its controls to notice.

    python3 launchpad/scripts/mutation_harness.py

A control that has never been observed failing has not been shown to test
anything. "The suite passes" is the claim this harness exists to refuse. Three
phases, and it exits non-zero if any of them finds a blind spot.

**Mutation.** Each function in TARGETS has its body replaced by a constant and
the whole suite must go RED. A mutant that SURVIVES is a control gap, named in
the output. Each target states the constant it becomes, rather than the harness
inferring one, so the mutation is legible: you can read what the function was
reduced to and judge whether killing it is a fair test. The constants are the
plausible wrong answer a careless implementation would return, not gibberish that
anything would catch.

TARGETS is not every function in the tree — it is every function whose logic a
control claims to check. A reviewer found three of those missing (``Read.ok``,
``RecordError.__init__``, ``_epilogue``); they are in the list now.

**Branch mutation.** Whole-function neutering cannot see a MISSING BRANCH: it
fails everything indiscriminately, which proves the function is called and
nothing about any decision inside it. A reviewer proved the gap by deleting the
org-rulesets 404-to-forbidden case, the 5xx case and the in-band GraphQL errors
block — each left the suite green while both enclosing functions were in TARGETS
and both "killed". This phase disables one branch at a time instead.

**Injection.** Each of a list of forbidden imports is added to a module — at the
top level and inside function bodies — and the no-model check must REFUSE it.
``importlib.import_module`` and ``__import__`` are in that list because they
create no Import node at all, so an import-name scan reports them as absent while
the no-model rule is broken outright.

Every phase restores the files from the originals held in memory through one
helper that verifies the restoration byte-for-byte — a harness that leaves a mutant in
the tree is worse than no harness at all. It also refuses to start if the suite is
already red, so a survivor can never be a pre-existing failure misread as a
control gap.
