"""Deterministic pre-flight for the PR review agent — launchpad-26/buzz#116.

Pure functions over already-fetched data. **No subprocess, no network, and no
model call happens in this module** — every input arrives as a :class:`Read` that
somebody else performed, which is what makes the whole surface testable from
recorded fixtures. ``preflight_fetch`` does the talking to ``gh``.

The record
==========

Seven top-level fields, enumerated here so that a later change has a fixed list
to be checked against rather than an open-ended "every field". **Adding a field
to the record means adding it to this list in the same commit.**

==================  ========================================================
``pr``              number, title, body, labels, base_ref, head_sha
``closing_issue``   present, keyword, issue_numbers, source, text_disagrees,
                    text_issue_numbers
``diff``            merge_base_sha, head_sha, files[path, added, removed, status]
``checks``          [name, workflow, status, conclusion, required, details_url]
``required_gate``   configured, source_endpoint, review_required,
                    review_decision, review_source_endpoint
``nearest_rules``   per changed path, the resolved AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md
``skips``           [field, source, reason, detail, endpoint]
==================  ========================================================

``checks`` is a **list, never a name-keyed map.** PR 86 carries three checks all
named ``check``; a map would silently drop two of them and the record would
under-report the gate.

The SKIP taxonomy
=================

One enumerated reason per unreadable input. The distinctions exist because
collapsing them is how "we could not look" gets published as "there is nothing
there".

===============  =========================================================
``absent``       the API said 404 — the thing is not there
``forbidden``    403, or a 404 that hides access rather than reporting
                 absence (``GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets`` without ``admin:org``
                 answers 404 for an organization that demonstrably exists)
``malformed``    not JSON, or JSON whose shape the reader cannot use
``empty``        read successfully, and genuinely carries nothing
``truncated``    the API knowingly returned part of the answer — HTTP 200
                 with ``truncated: true``, which is a failed read wearing a
                 success's clothes
``unreachable``  the call was never completed: no ``gh`` binary, a timeout, a
                 transport error. Distinct from ``absent`` because "we never
                 asked" must not be reported as "it does not exist"
===============  =========================================================

The exit contract
=================

A field is one of two kinds, and the kinds decide the exit code. Without this
split the "exit non-zero when a required input cannot be read" rule is
meaningless, and "SKIP everything, always exit 0" would satisfy every other
criterion this script has.

**REQUIRED** — a failure to read exits non-zero. Five inputs:

``pr``
    the pull request itself: does it exist, what did it fork from
``meta``
    its title, body and labels
``compare``
    the merge-base comparison the diff is read from
``checks``
    the check list
``tree``
    the head-tree listing ``nearest_rules`` resolves against

**SKIP-ONLY** — absence is a legitimate reportable state and the exit stays 0:

``org_rulesets``
    org-level ruleset visibility, unreadable without ``admin:org``
``branch_rules``
    repo-level rules for the base branch. Readable and empty is a *fact*: it
    means no gate is configured, reported as ``configured: false`` naming the
    endpoint that said so, never as a silent zero
``review_decision``
    whether a review gate exists on this base. The only gate signal readable
    without ``admin:org``; unreadable yields ``review_required: None``, never False
``closing_refs``
    GitHub's own answer to what the PR closes. Unreadable yields
    ``closing_issue.present: None`` — unknown, never False, because "we could not
    ask" and "it closes nothing" differ on whether the board updates on merge
*a path with no ancestor rules file at all*
    a real answer, not a failure

**``empty`` is never fatal, whichever kind the field belongs to.** An empty
answer was read. A head commit with no check runs yet and a check list that could
not be fetched are different facts, and only the second is a failure.

``truncated`` is why those two kinds do not blur. The trees API does not fail
loudly when it cannot return a whole tree: it answers HTTP 200 with
``truncated: true`` and a partial list past roughly 100,000 entries or 7 MB. A
path whose rules file sits beyond that boundary then looks exactly like the
SKIP-ONLY "no ancestor file" case while the real cause is an incomplete REQUIRED
read. So a truncated tree is a **tree-listing failure** and exits non-zero. This
fork is nowhere near the limit — 4337 entries at the time of writing — but this
is a CLI that takes any PR number, so the guard is required, not hypothetical.

That classification is a judgement, not a fact, and a reviewer may move any line
of it.

Containment
===========

Author-controlled text (title, body, per-file paths) is carried through as
**data** and never interpreted: it lands in labelled JSON string fields, which
CONTAINMENT.md § Contract for later stages permits for a stage that builds no
prompt. That permission is contingent on this module making no model call, so if
that ever changes, containment moves in with it. See ``INTERFACE.md``.

    **GitHub decides.** ``closingIssuesReferences`` is the only reliable answer,
    and a pattern over the body disagrees with it in both directions on real pull
    requests in this repository:

    - PR 86 closes two issues and its body says so on consecutive lines. A
      first-match ``re.search`` — which is what the plan specified — reports only
      #79, so it under-reports what the merge will do. ``finditer`` sees both, and
      a control reproduces the single search to pin the difference.
    - PR 92's body writes a visible ``Closes #n`` and GitHub reports **nothing**,
      because the PR's base was not the default branch — merging it would close
      no issue at all.
    - A reference written inside code is ignored by GitHub and matched by a
      regex. CommonMark has more code forms than a pattern enumerates; four of
      them defeated the launchpad PR-body check (launchpad-26/buzz#125).

    The body is still read, for two things a reference list cannot give: **which
    keyword** the author wrote, and whether the text and GitHub **disagree**. A
    disagreement is reportable signal — it is exactly the shape of #125 — so it
    is recorded rather than resolved silently.

    HTML comments are stripped before the text is scanned, in the PR-body check's
    order, so an unfilled ``<!-- Fixes #1234 -->`` placeholder is not read as a
    reference by the text half either.

    An unreadable ``closingIssuesReferences`` yields ``present: None`` — unknown.

    """Whether any check is required, and which endpoint said so.

    An empty required set is reported as ``configured: false`` **naming the
    endpoint that answered**, never as a silent zero — a zero is
    indistinguishable from a scope failure.

    **Two different gates, asked separately, because only one is invisible.**
    ``launchpad/AGENTS.md`` §6 states the position and it is not a contradiction
    to report: the ``launchpad`` branch requires *at least two approving reviews*,
    the ruleset enforcing it is unreadable without ``admin:org`` — three endpoints
    report nothing — but **a live PR's ``reviewDecision`` confirms that review is
    required**, without exposing the count.

    So this record asks for both:

    ``configured`` / ``source_endpoint``
        whether a required *status check* gate is visible, and what answered.
    ``review_required`` / ``review_decision`` / ``review_source_endpoint``
        whether a *review* gate exists, from the one signal this token can read.

    Reporting `configured: false` while never asking `reviewDecision` would have
    told a consumer that nothing gates this branch, on a branch that needs two
    approvals — an absence published as an answer while the evidence was one call
    away. ``reviewDecision`` carries no count, so the count stays unknown rather
    than being inferred.

    **What ``configured: false`` does and does not mean.** It means nothing
    *visible to this token* requires a check. Two blind spots survive, and both
    are why the org-ruleset skip must be published alongside the false rather
    than instead of it:

    - An org-level ruleset is unreadable without ``admin:org``. Its effect leaks
      through per-context ``isRequired``, which is why that is consulted too.
    - A required context that **never ran** is absent from the rollup entirely,
      so ``isRequired`` cannot report it. A ruleset requiring a check that never
      started is therefore invisible from here.

    So ``configured: false`` is a statement about what could be seen. The skip
    entry beside it is what stops that being read as a statement about what is.
