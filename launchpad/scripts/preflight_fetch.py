"""The pre-flight's fetch layer and CLI — launchpad-26/buzz#116.

This module is where the talking to ``gh`` happens, and the only place in the
tree that spawns a process. It exists as a separate module from the CLI script so
that controls can ``import`` it: ``pr-preflight.py`` cannot be imported under
that name, and a fetch layer no control can drive is a fetch layer no control can
make fail.

**The runner is injected.** Every call goes through a ``runner(argv) ->
RunResult`` callable that defaults to :func:`gh_runner`. Controls pass a fake that
answers from recorded fixtures, so the whole surface — including each way a fetch
can fail — is exercisable with no network. Hardcoding ``subprocess.run(["gh",
...])` at each call site would make that impossible without a rewrite.

Nine reads, five of them required
=================================

================  ======================================================  =========
name              call                                                    kind
================  ======================================================  =========
pr                ``GET /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}``                         required
meta              ``gh pr view {n} --json title,body,labels``              required
compare           ``GET /repos/{o}/{r}/compare/{base.sha}...{head.sha}``   required
checks            GraphQL ``statusCheckRollup`` with ``isRequired``        required
tree              ``GET /repos/{o}/{r}/git/trees/{head}?recursive=1``      required
branch_rules      ``GET /repos/{o}/{r}/rules/branches/{base}``             skip-only
org_rulesets      ``GET /orgs/{o}/rulesets``                               skip-only
closing_refs      GraphQL ``closingIssuesReferences``                      skip-only
review_decision   ``gh pr view {n} --json reviewDecision``                 skip-only
================  ======================================================  =========

``review_decision`` is the only gate signal this token can read: §6's ruleset is
invisible without ``admin:org``, and ``reviewDecision`` confirms review is
*required* without exposing the count.

``compare`` is taken **by SHA**, ``base.sha...head.sha``, never by base branch
name: a name resolves to the tip today, and for a merged PR that tip already
contains the head, so the API answers ``200 OK`` with zero files — a real PR
rendered as one that changed nothing.

Exit codes
==========

===  =====================================================================
0    a record was emitted on stdout. It may carry SKIP-only entries
1    usage error — a bad argument, nothing was fetched
2    a REQUIRED input could not be read. Nothing is printed on stdout
===  =====================================================================

Exit 2 prints the skip register on **stderr** and nothing on stdout, so a caller
that pipes stdout into a reviewer never receives a record with holes in it.
