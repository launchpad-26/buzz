Issue #117 — task: the parallel review dimensions that produce findings
Stated size: none given — the task template has no Size field  ->  cap: 12 steps

Sized by asking, not guessing. Answered: more than an hour, so the cap is 12.
Three further answers shape this plan and were also asked rather than assumed:
three dimensions — secrets-and-access, claim-vs-evidence, and
correctness-and-failure-modes; the semantic-injection cases #120 hands to #117
are a cross-cutting clause in every dimension, not a fourth dimension; and the
falsifiability criterion is met by recorded outputs for the deterministic suite
plus one live prompt-mutation run per dimension, pasted raw into the PR body.

Larger than an hour is flagged, not refused. These would have been better issues,
each observable on its own — splitting is the reader's call, not this plan's:

  (a) the findings contract alone — record shape, severity ladder, anchoring
      rules, completion marker — which is the artefact #118 and #119 are blocked on
  (b) the concurrent runner with a stub reviewer, proving isolation and the
      clean-versus-failed distinction with no prompt written yet
  (c) the three dimension definitions and their scopes
  (d) the fixture diffs, recorded outputs, and the mutation evidence

Planned as written below.

ALREADY TRUE  (verified against git, the working trees and the GitHub API, not notes)
  A note on how the containment tree is cited below. It is UNCOMMITTED and being
  actively edited: between this plan's first and second review passes,
  contain.Finding's severity default moved from line 66 to 83, contain.render from
  214 to 233, `_gh`'s docstring from fetch.py:40 to 43, and the Finding call sites
  from four to FIVE. Every substantive claim survived; only the pins rotted. So
  the claims below name SYMBOLS and FILES, not line numbers. A line number pinned
  to a file on no branch is a citation with a half-life, and re-pinning it each
  time it drifts teaches a reader to trust a number that is wrong again by the
  time they read it.
  Branch feat/review-agent-dimensions is at d897a06e8. `git rev-list
  --left-right --count origin/launchpad...HEAD` reports 0 0, so nothing of #117
  is built. `git ls-files | grep -iE 'dimension|reviewer|review-agent'` matches
  one unrelated upstream React file — desktop/src/features/projects/ui/
  PullRequestReviewersRow.tsx — and nothing of this work.
  Toolchain present: python3 3.12.3, gh 2.93.0.
  ADR #110 is decided and #117 is unaffected by it. The decision comment chooses
  GitHub Actions for Phase 1 with a committed revisit, and the credential is a
  GitHub token scoped to launchpad-26/buzz (pull-request write, contents read) —
  no Buzz identity, deferred explicitly. The comment names #116 and #119 as what
  it unblocks and states that "#117, #118 and #120 never depended on this ADR and
  are unaffected". So this plan adds NO workflow file: #120 already added
  .github/workflows/launchpad-review-agent-controls.yml (untracked, see below)
  and the dimensions' controls belong in that runner, not a second one.
  #120's work is COMMITTED as of 2026-08-13, and that changes the risk rather
  than removing it. Earlier revisions of this plan said the tree was "on no
  branch and in no commit". That is no longer true: it is committed and pushed
  on `feat/review-agent-untrusted-input`, carrying Python modules, CONTAINMENT.md
  and its fixtures. An earlier revision of THIS note cited three specific
  hashes for that claim — 618789584, e072fba55 and c64ff7958 — and none of the
  three is reachable from any branch as of this revision (`git branch --all
  --contains <hash>` returns nothing for each). The branch was rewritten, not
  merely advanced: its module count also moved, from 14 Python modules to 17.
  So this citation now names a mechanism rather than a hash, per BUDGET's own
  warning about pinned numbers: check `git log --oneline
  origin/feat/review-agent-untrusted-input` for the current tip and `git
  ls-tree -r origin/feat/review-agent-untrusted-input -- launchpad/review-agent/`
  for what is actually there, rather than trusting a count pinned here.
  What replaced the old risk is narrower and harder to notice: the branch is
  UNMERGED and its files are not reachable from here. `git rev-list --left-right
  --count origin/launchpad...origin/feat/review-agent-untrusted-input` reports
  0 3, and `ls launchpad/review-agent/` in this worktree fails — no such
  directory. So #120 landing first is a PRECONDITION of STEPs 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9,
  not a scheduling preference: STEP 2 must `import review`, and STEP 9 must add a
  row to a `run_controls.py` that is not on this branch. The precondition is
  discharged by #120 merging to `launchpad` and this branch rebasing onto it —
  never by copying those files into this branch, which would create the second
  source of truth LEFT OUT forbids and a guaranteed conflict when #120 lands.
  See BUDGET.
  CONTAINMENT.md is normative and binds #117 by name. Its "Contract for later
  stages" table requires #117 to call `contain.render(surfaces, nonce)` "before
  any text reaches a model" and forbids placing "any surface above the preamble or
  after the closing marker". That function exists and its signature is
  `render(surfaces: dict, nonce: str, *, enabled: bool = True) -> tuple[str,
  list, bool]`, returning (document, findings, all_readable) — contain.py:214. It
  already folds in `detect.detect` findings itself, so a caller that also calls
  `detect.detect` double-reports.
  Part of the output contract is already set, and it does not carry file:line.
  `contain.Finding` is a dataclass of kind, entry_point, evidence,
  severity="Blocker" (contain.py), and every one of its five call sites — one
  delimiter_forge and three delimiter_lookalike in contain.py, plus
  injection_attempt in detect.py — takes that default rather than overriding it,
  so every containment finding is a Blocker in practice and not only by contract.
  The severity ladder is {"Blocker": 0, "High": 1, "Medium": 2, "Low": 3} in
  review.py — at line 32 as of this writing, though see the citation note above;
  the first review pass proposed 19 and this plan originally said 20, and both
  were wrong. #117's own done-criteria
  require severity, file:line, a one-line defect statement and the concrete
  failure — three of those four have no field in the existing record. Reconciling
  the two is the central design act of this issue, not a detail.
  #120 has already assigned #117 a coverage gap in writing, and the numbers moved
  after this plan's second pass. CONTAINMENT.md § Detection now records detect.py
  catching 28 of 35 attack matrix cases and missing 7 — SEMANTIC PARAPHRASE ONLY —
  at 0 false positives, and says those 7 "are #117's responsibility, not an
  accident" and that the dependency "is written down here because it is otherwise
  invisible from inside #117". detect.py's own docstring repeats it.
  Earlier revisions of this plan said 21 caught and 14 missed, and named
  finding-suppression among the missed. Both were true when written and are now
  wrong: a commit titled "stop claiming a tell is unambiguous" (check
  `git log --oneline origin/feat/review-agent-untrusted-input -- detect.py` for
  its current hash rather than trusting one pinned here — an earlier revision's
  pin, c64ff7958, is no longer reachable, per the citation-rot note above) added
  the suppression rule as `detect._SUPPRESS`, so suppression is CAUGHT. Verified by
  running the real detector against a suppression-shaped test sentence — the same
  shape `_SUPPRESS`'s own comment describes (a negated reporting verb whose object is
  the review's own output) without spelling it out, for the reason that comment
  gives: writing the literal example trips the rule wherever it is written, including
  here. (An earlier revision of this note DID spell it out verbatim, which is exactly
  what made `check_step6.py`'s own corpus scan start flagging this file as a false
  positive against itself — a self-inflicted instance of the identical problem this
  paragraph is busy explaining. Fixed by following the convention CONTAINMENT.md and
  detect.py's docstring already use, rather than by touching the detector.) That
  sentence returns one finding.
  This correction is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, because STEP 5 and STEP 7
  scope their injection fixture by "the classes detect.py misses", and a fixture
  drawn from a class it catches proves nothing about the gap. The ALREADY TRUE
  note above warns that pinned LINE NUMBERS rot; this is the same warning applied
  to a pinned MEASUREMENT, which rotted the same way and was not re-checked.
  Surface is the input shape. `fetch.Surface` is entry_point, state, text, reason
  with state in ok | empty | absent | oversized | unparseable and a `readable`
  property (fetch.py:31). Caps are 512 KiB per entry point and 2 MiB per
  invocation (fetch.py:21), and oversized input is refused, never truncated.
  `fetch.fetch_all` NEVER signals a hard failure, and this shapes STEP 3. Its
  helper `_gh` is documented "Never raises on a failed call" (fetch.py:40) and
  converts every gh failure — 404, missing auth, network outage, timeout,
  non-UTF-8 — into the same `Surface(entry_point, "absent", reason=...)`. A
  nonexistent PR is therefore indistinguishable from an unreachable one at the
  Surface level; only the free-text `reason` differs. `fetch_all` raises only if
  an entry point is missing from its own output (fetch.py:125).
  There is NO merge-base or head-SHA logic in the containment tree. `grep -ni
  'sha|merge_base|head'` across fetch.py and contain.py matches nothing but an
  unrelated hashlib call. `fetch_all` does fetch the full PR JSON but narrows it
  immediately through `lambda d: d["title"]` and `d.get("body")`, so the SHAs on
  that response are discarded, and `contain.render` returns no SHA either. Any
  step needing the commit pair must resolve it itself — see STEP 3.
  `fetch.from_payload(path)` (fetch.py:148) loads a captured PR from disk so a
  control need not touch live GitHub, and `fetch.degrade(surfaces, spec)`
  (fetch.py:163) forces a named surface into a degenerate state. These are the
  offline seams STEPs 7 and 8 depend on.
  A control-runner pattern already exists to extend rather than reinvent.
  run_controls.py holds a CONTROLS list of (script, needs_network) pairs, probes
  `gh api rate_limit` for connectivity, and reports SKIP with a reason — never
  PASS — for a control whose input is missing.
  #116's plan is committed and does not overlap this work.
  origin/feat/review-agent-preflight carries launchpad/plans/
  2026-08-12-issue-116-pr-review-preflight.md (354 lines) and nothing else —
  `git ls-tree -r origin/feat/review-agent-preflight -- launchpad/` lists only the
  pre-existing launchpad files plus that plan. So the pre-flight record #117 would
  ideally consume DOES NOT EXIST as code yet. Its STEP 2 enumerates the record's
  seven top-level keys (pr, closing_issue, diff, checks, required_gate,
  nearest_rules, skips) and its OPEN section leaves "whether the emitted record
  carries a schema version, so the later review dimensions in #109 can depend on
  its shape" undecided.
  launchpad/plans/ is the established path. launchpad/AGENTS.md §3 puts all cohort
  files under launchpad/ and bars root docs/ and root scripts/ as upstream's
  trees; #116's plan landed at launchpad/plans/ for that reason and #120's
  uncommitted plan sits beside it. The skill's default docs/plans/ is not used
  here, and docs/plans/ does not exist in this checkout.
  No verify gate is installed in this checkout — .claude/settings.json and
  .claude/settings.local.json are both absent — so every review skill is a manual
  invocation and none will fire on its own.
  #118's issue body still carries the wording #122 corrected. #109 has been
  amended in place (struck through, with the corrected claim following). #118's
  "Note on why this stage is treated sceptically" has not: it still reads "AUROC
  0.48–0.64 against 6,642 human-verified labels, and did so despite high
  performance on standard validation sets". Per #122's verification 1 of 3, the
  AUROC range is one judge (JailJudge), one victim model (Llama-3.1-8B), two
  attacks (GCG and GCG-R) — not a range across judges — and "despite high
  performance on standard validation sets" is not a quotation from the paper. What
  is confirmed verbatim is that judges perform "on average only slightly better
  than a random coin-flip" against the 6,642 labels. Amending #118 is not this
  issue's work; it is recorded in OPEN so it is not lost.

STEP 1  launchpad/review-agent/FINDINGS.md — the output contract,        [independent]
        normative. The artefact #118 and #119 are both blocked on — #119's plan is
        already committed against revision 3 of it, so this step's change list is
        part of the deliverable, not a courtesy. #117's issue says the contract
        is "agreed in whichever of the two lands first, then honoured by the
        other", and #117 is planning first, so it is settled here in enough detail
        that #118 implements against it without renegotiating. Written as a
        sibling to CONTAINMENT.md and in the same normative voice.
        The severity ladder is IMPORTED, not redefined: Blocker | High | Medium |
        Low, from review.py's SEVERITY_ORDER. A second copy of a four-value ladder
        drifts, and the containment findings that share the output stream are
        already fixed to Blocker by CONTAINMENT.md § Severity contract.
        How a finding carries file:line — the part most likely to be got wrong.
        Three anchor kinds, one required field naming which applies, and validation
        that refuses the mismatched combinations:
          anchor "line" — file required, line required, renders launchpad/AGENTS.md:42
          anchor "file" — file required, line MUST BE NULL, renders launchpad/AGENTS.md
          anchor "pr"   — file MUST BE NULL, line MUST BE NULL, renders (pull request)
        The rule exists because the alternative is a reviewer inventing line 1 for
        a finding that is really about a whole file or the PR as a whole. That is
        false precision, and #118 would then try to verify a defect at a location
        where it is not — producing a REFUTED verdict for a finding that was true.
        An anchor field makes "this defect has no line" expressible instead of
        forcing a lie.
        THE ANCHOR IS NOT A FREE CHOICE, and this is the half the first two
        revisions left out. Structural validity is not appropriateness: anchor "pr"
        with both fields null satisfies every rule above for ANY finding, so it is
        the cheapest thing an uncertain reviewer can emit, and it is unfalsifiable
        by construction — #118 cannot refute a defect at a location it was never
        given. Left unconstrained, a dimension may report every finding as anchor
        "pr", pass every rule in STEP 2 and every control in STEP 9, and still
        satisfy none of #117's second done-criterion, which requires file:line.
        So: a defect visible at a line of the merge-base diff MUST use anchor
        "line"; a defect that is a property of a whole file MUST use "file"; "pr"
        is legitimate ONLY where the defect has no file — a missing file, a claim
        in the PR body, a property of the change as a whole. STEP 4 states this per
        dimension and STEP 9 controls it against the planted locations STEP 7
        records, because a rule with no control is guidance and this one is load-
        bearing.
        `line` is a NEW-SIDE line number in the merge-base diff, i.e. of the file
        at head_sha. Old-side and new-side numbers differ in every diff that adds
        or removes lines above the finding, so the side is stated, not assumed.
        The finding record. Field names are final here:
          dimension    which reviewer produced it — one of STEP 4's three slugs
          severity     Blocker | High | Medium | Low
          anchor       line | file | pr
          file         repo-relative path, or null when anchor is pr
          line         new-side line number, or null unless anchor is line
          defect       ONE line: what is wrong
          failure      the concrete failure the defect allows
          finding_id   stable id, see below
          entry_point  REQUIRED on any finding whose defect is an injection
                       attempt — one of CONTAINMENT.md's seven labels, naming the
                       surface the text came from. Null on every other finding.
                       Required rather than optional because an injection finding
                       that names no surface is the detected-then-dropped case
                       CONTAINMENT.md calls worse than never detecting it, and a
                       field that is merely "optional" is a field a converter drops
                       without failing any rule. STEP 5's clause is what produces
                       these, for the 7 paraphrase cases detect.py misses.
          evidence     REQUIRED whenever entry_point is set, RAW — the excerpt the
                       finding rests on, exactly as the author wrote it, NOT
                       escaped. Escaping belongs to the renderer: review.py:72
                       applies `contain.escape` at render time to a raw-evidence
                       record, and every contain.Finding in the system carries raw
                       evidence. A record that arrives pre-escaped is escaped twice
                       by that renderer — a `~` publishes as `~~~~` — so the excerpt
                       stops matching what the author wrote. Null elsewhere: a
                       dimension's finding is already located by file and line, and
                       quoting the diff back adds bulk without adding evidence.
        Ten fields, and the count is load-bearing — STEP 9 builds one control per
        field, so a field that exists in the output but not in this list gets no
        control at all. `evidence` was exactly that: an earlier revision mapped it
        in a conversion while declaring only nine fields, which would have either
        dropped the excerpt or grown an undeclared tenth field that no control
        exercised.
        WHERE CONTAINMENT FINDINGS LIVE. Settled here, normatively, because two
        earlier revisions left it ambiguous and #118 and #119 both parse this shape.
        Containment findings do NOT enter the `findings` array of any dimension
        report, and they are NOT converted into the ten-field record above. They
        travel as a TOP-LEVEL SIBLING KEY of the merged document, named
        `containment`, carrying `contain.Finding` verbatim in JSON:
          containment.findings[]  severity, kind, entry_point, evidence — the four
                                  fields of the contain.Finding dataclass, raw and
                                  unrenamed. `kind` is one of delimiter_forge,
                                  delimiter_lookalike, injection_attempt.
          containment.states      a map of ALL SEVEN entry points to their
                                  fetch.Surface state (ok | empty | absent |
                                  oversized | unparseable). All seven, always,
                                  including the ones that succeeded.
        Three reasons, and the first alone decides it. `review.render_review` —
        the function CONTAINMENT.md's stage table binds #119 to call — reads
        `.severity`, `.kind`, `.entry_point` and `.evidence` BY ATTRIBUTE off a
        contain.Finding, and takes a second argument `states` that no stage
        currently emits. A converted ten-field record has no `kind`, so it cannot
        reach the published review through that function at all, and the conversion
        would strand exactly the findings CONTAINMENT.md § Severity contract
        requires to appear. Second, escaping: review.py:72 applies
        `contain.escape` at render, so evidence must arrive raw or it is escaped
        twice. Third, #118 does not need the conversion — CONTAINMENT.md's stage
        table already routes it to `contain.findings_for(surfaces, nonce)` for
        exactly this data, so converting would give #118 two sources for one fact.
        `states` is load-bearing and is the easiest thing here to get wrong. It
        feeds render_review's "Incomplete" banner, which is DERIVED from it against
        `UNREADABLE_STATES` rather than passed in. A `states` map populated only for
        the surfaces that succeeded makes every unreadable surface read as
        absent-from-the-map, and the banner never renders — a review over three
        unreadable surfaces publishing as complete. Hence "all seven, always", and
        hence a control in STEP 9 that counts the keys rather than checking the key
        exists.
        There is no reserved "containment" dimension slug, and no dimension report
        carries a containment finding. An earlier revision reserved that slug; it is
        withdrawn, because a sibling key separates the deterministic catches from
        the model's judgement more cleanly than a slug inside a shared array, and
        because a dimension report whose `findings` array holds a containment
        finding would have to declare `outcome: "findings"` and so report a
        dimension as having found something it did not.
        `defect` and `failure` are two fields, not one, because #117's
        done-criteria name them separately and because a defect statement with no
        stated consequence is what lets an unfalsifiable finding through. #118
        re-rates severity, so the reporting dimension's value must remain readable
        after adjudication rather than being overwritten in place.
        `finding_id` is a truncated hash of (dimension, anchor, file, line,
        entry_point, defect, evidence). It is stable across re-runs of an unchanged
        diff, which is what lets #118 attach exactly one verdict per finding and
        makes its dedupe visible rather than silent. It is NOT stable across a model
        rewording `defect` — stated plainly here because a reader will otherwise
        assume it is, and because dedupe across rewordings is #118's job, not this
        id's.
        `entry_point` and `evidence` are in the hash inputs, and an earlier revision
        omitted both. Two findings that differ only by which surface they came from,
        or only by the excerpt they rest on, are two findings — `contain._dedupe`
        keys its own identity on exactly (kind, entry_point, evidence) for that
        reason. Without them, two injection findings from the same dimension whose
        `defect` line happens to match — the same paraphrase in `pr_body` and in
        `pr_diff` — hash to one id, and #118 either attaches one verdict to two
        attacks or dedupes by id and silently drops one. Dropping one is the
        detected-then-dropped case again, arriving through the id rather than
        through a missing field.
        The report envelope, one per dimension:
          schema_version    integer, starts at 1
          dimension         the slug
          pr                number

        The merged document STEP 3 prints on stdout wraps those envelopes and is
        the whole of #117's output contract:

          merge_base_sha    the commit pair every report read
          head_sha
          reports           array of exactly the dimension envelopes above, one per
                            slug printed by `--list`, and nothing else in it
          containment       the block specified above — findings plus a seven-key
                            states map. Present on every run. A run with no
                            containment findings emits an EMPTY findings array and
                            a full states map, never a missing key: #119 reads a
                            missing `containment` as an incomplete review, which is
                            the right reading and must be reserved for the case
                            where this stage genuinely could not produce one.
          nonce             the run nonce, once, at the top level — the same value
                            contain.render wrapped every surface with and every
                            report's completion_marker embeds. See below for what
                            it does and does not prove.
        WHY THE NONCE IS A KEY, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. Without it the nonce exists
        only INSIDE each report's completion_marker string, so a downstream stage
        can compare markers to each other and nothing more. #119's STEP 5 makes a
        review incomplete when a report's marker "carries the wrong dimension or
        nonce" — a condition its own input could not support, because no nonce
        reached it. This key is what makes that check implementable, and it is the
        reason it exists. It is NOT an authentication token for the document:
        anyone fabricating the whole document sets the key and the markers
        consistently, and no value carried in plaintext beside the thing it
        authenticates can prevent that. What it catches is the threat the marker was
        designed against — a forged marker COPIED OUT OF THE AUTHOR'S DIFF by a
        reviewer that echoed it — because that marker carries whatever nonce the
        author typed and not this run's. Stated plainly because "the document now
        carries a nonce" reads like a stronger claim than it is, and an overclaimed
        control is worse than an absent one.
        The trust boundary, named rather than assumed: #117, #118 and #119 run in
        one CI job, so the merged document does not cross an untrusted boundary. The
        untrusted text is the model output each dimension returns, and that is where
        the marker check bites. If a later phase ever moves a stage to a separate
        job or a separate machine, this key stops being sufficient and the boundary
        needs signing, not a shared plaintext value.
        The nonce must NOT be rendered into the published review body. #119 has no
        use for it beyond the check, and printing a per-run secret into a public
        comment teaches a reader it is not one. Leaking it after the run is harmless
        — it is fresh per run and that run has ended — but there is no reason to.
        STEP 8's recordings carry a nonce, and a COMMITTED recording's nonce must be
        seed-derived via `contain.make_nonce(seed)` rather than copied from a live
        run, so a fixture value is never mistaken for a production one.
        This is deliberately the document #119 already reads, plus the nonce it
        needs and minus the one key it adds itself. #119's STEP 7 takes
        `{pr, head_sha, merge_base_sha, stages, reports, containment}` on stdin,
        where `stages` is ~~its own manifest covering stages that emit no
        envelope~~ a manifest naming EVERY stage the review depended on, including
        each of this issue's dimensions by slug. So
        `reports` and `containment` mean here exactly what they mean there, #119
        wraps rather than restates, and `nonce` is a sixth key it should add to that
        document and check.
        CORRECTED 2026-08-27 (launchpad-26/buzz#565). The struck wording is the
        superseded reading #119's plan STEP 5 replaced on 2026-08-14, and leaving it
        standing had a consequence rather than being a wording nit: built to it, the
        manifest held only stages with no envelope of their own, so no dimension was
        ever named, and #119's condition (7) — "a dimension named by the manifest
        produced no report at all" — could never fire. A three-dimension run that
        produced two reports rendered as COMPLETE. The dimension entries are sourced
        from `list_dimensions()`, what this stage DISPATCHED, never from
        `reports[].dimension`: a report cannot testify to its own absence. See
        `FINDINGS.md` § The merged document > The stages manifest.
        `outcome: clean` is how "a dimension that finds nothing says so
        explicitly" is distinguished from `status: failed`. Both are legitimate
        outputs; neither is an empty findings array standing alone, which is
        exactly the ambiguity the criterion forbids.
        The completion marker carries the run nonce. Its value is
        BUZZ-DIMENSION-COMPLETE:{dimension}:{nonce}, using the same nonce
        contain.render wrapped the surfaces with, and it is the LAST key emitted.
        Two reasons, and the second is not obvious: a marker at the end cannot
        survive truncation, so a report cut off mid-findings has no marker and is
        treated as truncated rather than clean; and a marker with NO nonce is a
        fixed string published in a public repository, which a PR author can type
        into their own diff. A reviewer reading a contained diff containing a
        forged marker could emit it, and a naive scan of model output would then
        read a truncated report as complete. The nonce makes the marker
        unforgeable by anyone who has not seen it, on the same reasoning
        CONTAINMENT.md gives for the envelope delimiter. `contain.make_nonce` is
        reused, including its refusal to accept a caller-supplied nonce.
        One nonce per RUN, not per dimension — all three reports embed the same
        value. So "carries another dimension's nonce" is not an input this contract
        can produce, and a check written against that phrasing tests nothing. The
        checks that do bite are: a marker whose nonce differs from the merged
        document's `nonce`, and markers that disagree with each other. Both are
        stated here because a downstream stage phrasing the condition the other way
        would build a fixture no run can generate.
        `findings_count` must equal len(findings). A report truncated mid-array
        fails that equality even if it somehow parses.
        CONTRACT CHANGES SINCE REVISION 3 — for #118 and #119 to diff. #119's plan
        is committed against revision 3 and names its field list explicitly, so
        this block exists so its author can diff old against new without reading a
        review. Six changes, and number 6 was raised BY #119's own review — its
        finding that the nonce half of its completion-marker check could not be
        implemented from the input this contract supplied. It was right, and the fix
        belongs here rather than there:
          1. Containment findings are a top-level `containment` sibling key
             carrying raw contain.Finding (severity, kind, entry_point, evidence)
             plus a seven-key `states` map. Revision 3 converted them into
             ten-field records under a reserved "containment" dimension slug. That
             slug is WITHDRAWN. This is the key #119's OPEN says #117 must add, and
             it is now added with the shape #119 specified.
          2. `evidence` is RAW, not post-escape. Revision 3 said post-escape.
             #119's control comparing against `contain.escape(evidence)` is correct
             against this revision and was wrong against revision 3.
          3. `entry_point` is REQUIRED on an injection finding, not optional, and
             `evidence` is required with it. Revision 3 made both droppable.
          4. `finding_id` hashes (dimension, anchor, file, line, entry_point,
             defect, evidence). Revision 3 hashed (dimension, anchor, file, line,
             defect). #119 uses finding_id only as a sort tie-break, so this costs
             it nothing, but #118 must use the new inputs.
          5. Revision 3 declared nine finding fields in one place and ten in
             another; the count is ten, and `evidence` is the tenth. #119's plan
             lists nine and states "#117's envelope carries neither kind nor
             evidence" — the `kind` half stays true (kind lives on the containment
             block, not the finding record), the `evidence` half does not.
          6. The merged document carries a top-level `nonce` key. Revision 3 carried
             the nonce only inside each report's completion_marker, so #119's
             STEP 5 condition "a report's completion_marker carries the wrong
             dimension or nonce" was unimplementable from its input. #119 should add
             `nonce` to its STEP 7 stdin document as a sixth key and check each
             marker against it. Two corrections come with it: the nonce is ONE PER
             RUN, so "another dimension's nonce" is not an input this contract can
             produce and a fixture built on that phrasing tests nothing — check a
             marker against the document's nonce instead; and the key is not an
             authentication token for the document, only for a marker echoed out of
             author text, so it must not be described as making the document
             unforgeable.
        The ten finding fields and eleven envelope fields are otherwise unchanged,
        and no field is renamed. #119's OPEN correctly predicted that a rename would
        cost it STEPs 4, 5, 6, 10 and 12; nothing here renames one.
        done when: FINDINGS.md exists under launchpad/review-agent/; it states all
        ten finding fields, all eleven envelope fields and all six merged-document
        keys by the names above; it states that the nonce is one per run, that a
        marker is checked against the document's `nonce` rather than against another
        dimension's, and that the key authenticates an echoed marker and NOT the
        document; it states that `entry_point` is required on an
        injection finding and `evidence` required with it and RAW; it states that
        containment findings travel in the `containment` sibling key and NOT in any
        dimension's findings array, that `states` carries all seven entry points,
        and that no dimension slug may be "containment"; it contains the three
        anchor rules with both "must be null" constraints AND the rule that a defect
        visible at a diff line must use anchor "line"; it names Blocker | High |
        Medium | Low and cites review.py as their source rather than restating the
        ladder as its own; it carries the five contract changes above so a reader of
        #119's plan can diff; and it is referenced from a new row in CONTAINMENT.md's
        "Contract for later stages" table so the two documents point at each other
        rather than diverging quietly.

STEP 2  launchpad/review-agent/findings.py — the contract in code.          [needs 1]
        Pure functions and dataclasses over already-fetched data. No subprocess,
        no network, no model call in this module. `Finding` and `Report`
        dataclasses, a `validate(report) -> list[str]` returning EVERY violation
        rather than raising on the first, and `parse(text) -> Report` for reading
        what a reviewer emitted.
        `validate` enforces, at minimum: the anchor/file/line combinations from
        STEP 1; severity in the imported ladder; findings_count == len(findings);
        the completion marker present, last, and matching the expected dimension
        AND nonce; status/outcome/error mutual exclusivity; non-empty `defect` and
        `failure`; `entry_point` present and one of CONTAINMENT.md's seven labels on
        every injection finding, with `evidence` present and non-empty alongside it;
        no dimension slug equal to "containment"; on the merged document, a
        `containment` key present whose `states` map carries all seven entry points
        and whose every finding has a `kind` in the three CONTAINMENT.md kinds — a
        six-key states map is a violation, not a shorter map; a top-level `nonce`
        present and equal to the nonce embedded in EVERY report's completion_marker,
        so a single report carrying a marker copied out of author text is rejected
        while the other two still validate; and — the rule
        the first revision was missing — `outcome` CROSS-CHECKED AGAINST THE
        FINDINGS ARRAY: "clean" requires findings to be empty, "findings" requires
        it non-empty. Without that rule a report reading status "complete", outcome
        "clean", findings [one real Blocker], findings_count 1 satisfies every
        other rule at once and validates cleanly. That is the exact inverse of the
        ambiguity `outcome` was added to remove, and it fails in the dangerous
        direction: a real finding published under the word "clean".
        A validator that stops at the first error hides the rest, and STEP 9's
        suite asserts on the full list.
        SEVERITY_ORDER is imported from review, not re-declared.
        done when: `python3 -c "import findings"` run from launchpad/review-agent/
        succeeds — NOT `py_compile`, which compiles without resolving imports and so
        passes on a module whose `import review` cannot be satisfied, which is the
        exact failure the #120 precondition in ALREADY TRUE exists to prevent;
        `validate` returns an empty list for a well-formed report and, for a report
        carrying three independent violations at once, returns three strings rather
        than one; a finding with anchor "pr" and a non-null file is rejected; a
        finding with anchor "line" and a null line is rejected; an injection finding
        with no `entry_point` is rejected, and one with an `entry_point` but no
        `evidence` is rejected; a merged document whose `containment.states` names
        six entry points is rejected; a dimension slug of "containment" is rejected;
        a merged document with no top-level `nonce` is rejected, and one where a
        single report's marker nonce differs from the document's is rejected NAMING
        THAT REPORT rather than failing the document wholesale; and
        `findings.SEVERITY_ORDER is review.SEVERITY_ORDER` is true.

STEP 3  launchpad/review-agent/run_dimensions.py — the concurrent  [needs 2]  <- RUNS HERE
        runner. The CLI shell, demonstrable before a single prompt is written.
        Takes a PR number, resolves the commit pair, calls `fetch.fetch_all(pr,
        repo)` then `contain.render(surfaces, nonce)`, runs the dimensions
        concurrently, and prints one merged JSON document containing every
        dimension's report on stdout.
        Three things this module must do that the containment tree does NOT do for
        it. Each was found by review of this plan, not by building it:
          THE COMMIT PAIR IS THIS MODULE'S JOB. Nothing in fetch.py or contain.py
          resolves a merge base or retains a head SHA — fetch_all narrows the PR
          JSON to title and body and discards the rest. So this module makes one
          further REST call, `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/compare/{base}...{head}`, and
          reads `.merge_base_commit.sha`, plus head_sha from the PR JSON. #116's
          plan establishes why it must be REST: there is no `mergeBaseCommit`
          field on the GraphQL PullRequest type, verified there by introspection.
          The trap it also names applies here unchanged — `baseRefOid` is the
          CURRENT TIP of the base branch, not the commit the head forked from, and
          diffing against it attributes every commit landed on launchpad since the
          fork to this PR's author.
          A NONEXISTENT PR MUST BE TOLD APART FROM A CREDENTIAL FAILURE. `_gh`
          never raises and collapses 404, missing auth, network outage and timeout
          into the same `absent` Surface, so `all_readable == False` cannot carry
          the distinction and treating it as "PR not found" would report an outage
          as a verdict about the PR. This module therefore probes CREDENTIAL
          IDENTITY once, explicitly, before fetching surfaces — `GET /user`, whose
          only possible answer is about the credential — and then reads the PR
          endpoint's status. An earlier revision probed `GET /repos/{o}/{r}`
          instead; that probe discriminates NOTHING here, because launchpad-26/buzz
          is public and the repo endpoint answers 200 to a caller with no
          credential at all. Verified: unauthenticated, the repo endpoint returns
          200 and a nonexistent PR returns 404, which is exactly the signature the
          old rule read as "the credential is fine and the PR is absent".
          THE TABLE BELOW ASSUMES A PERSONAL-TOKEN SHAPE, AND THAT IS NOT YET
          CONFIRMED. ADR #110's decision comment describes the actual CI credential
          in permission vocabulary — "a GitHub token scoped to launchpad-26/buzz
          (pull-request write, contents read)" — that matches a GitHub
          App/Actions installation token (the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` an Actions
          workflow runs with), not a personal access token. An installation token
          characteristically answers `GET /user` with 403 and
          `{"message": "Resource not accessible by integration"}`, because that
          endpoint asks for a human identity an installation token does not carry
          — it is not a sign the credential is dead, blocked, or rate-limited. The
          table's only existing 403 case is "blocked from this PR, or
          rate-limited", and folding this one into that branch would classify
          every healthy run under this credential type as INFRASTRUCTURE. So:
          BEFORE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROBE, confirm via a real CI run (or #110's
          provisioning docs, once #119 settles them) whether the credential
          actually presented to `run_dimensions.py` is a personal token or an
          installation token, and branch the classification below accordingly —
          do not assume the personal-token shape the 200/401 rows describe.
          What each response means, stated rather than left to a reader:
            GET /user 200            the credential is live. Its login is printed,
                                     so a run is attributable. (Personal-token
                                     shape only — see the caveat above.)
            GET /user 403            EXPECTED under a confirmed installation
                                     token, and NOT the same case as the
                                     PR-endpoint 403 below. The message is
                                     "Resource not accessible by integration",
                                     distinct from a blocked-or-rate-limited
                                     message on the PR endpoint. Treat as LIVE and
                                     proceed to the PR endpoint; do not exit as
                                     INFRASTRUCTURE and do not attribute it to the
                                     PR. If the credential is confirmed
                                     personal-token instead, a 403 here has no
                                     defined meaning yet and must not be silently
                                     folded into this branch.
            GET /user 401            bad or expired credential -> INFRASTRUCTURE.
                                     Verified: an invalid token returns
                                     {"message": "Bad credentials"} on /user AND on
                                     the PR endpoint, so a dead token never reaches
                                     the PR classification at all.
            GET /user network/timeout INFRASTRUCTURE.
            then, with a live credential, on GET /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}:
            200                      proceed.
            404                      NO SUCH PR. Sound here only because the repo
                                     is public: a live credential can read any PR
                                     of a public repo, so absence is absence. If
                                     launchpad-26/buzz is ever made private this
                                     collapses — GitHub returns 404 rather than 403
                                     for a resource the caller cannot read, so as
                                     not to confirm existence — and the rule needs a
                                     visibility check before the 404 branch. The
                                     condition is named because it is invisible from
                                     inside the code.
            403                      the credential is live but blocked from this
                                     PR, or rate-limited. Distinguished by the
                                     message and the x-ratelimit-remaining header;
                                     rate-limited is INFRASTRUCTURE, blocked is its
                                     own reason.
            401                      the credential died between the two calls ->
                                     INFRASTRUCTURE.
          Every non-proceed outcome exits non-zero with its own reason string, never
          one shared "could not review". A 401 belongs to INFRASTRUCTURE and to
          nothing else: an earlier revision listed a 401 under both "cannot see it"
          and "infrastructure", which is two branches matching one input with no
          tie-break, so half of the implementations of it would have told an operator
          that a dead token was a fact about someone's pull request. The same
          discipline applies to the installation-token 403 above: it belongs to
          LIVE and to nothing else, and must not also match the PR-endpoint
          403 branch's "blocked or rate-limited" reason string.
          CONTAINMENT.MD'S OWN FINDINGS MUST BE CARRIED, IN THE `containment` KEY.
          `contain.render` returns (document, findings, all_readable) and the SECOND
          element is the deterministic 28-of-35 catches. This module emits every one
          of them verbatim — severity, kind, entry_point, evidence, raw and
          unrenamed — as the top-level `containment.findings` array per STEP 1, and
          emits `containment.states` from `fetch.Surface.state` for all seven entry
          points. It does NOT convert them into ten-field records and does NOT put
          them in any dimension's findings array. Dropping them would breach
          CONTAINMENT.md § Severity contract, which requires all three kinds to
          appear in the published review and calls a detected-then-dropped finding
          "worse than one never detected, because it reads as a clean review" — and
          the dimensions cannot cover the gap, because LEFT OUT scopes them to the 7
          that detection misses. `states` comes from the Surfaces this module already
          holds, so there is no second fetch; the seven-key requirement is a control
          in STEP 9 rather than a comment, because a map built only from the surfaces
          that succeeded silences #119's incomplete banner.
        The reviewer is an INJECTED CALLABLE, defaulting to a stub that returns a
        well-formed clean report. Two payoffs: the harness is provable end to end
        today, and every control in STEP 9 feeds recorded outputs with no model
        call and no network. This is also what keeps "choosing the model" out of
        scope, as #117 requires — the runner never names one.
        A `--payload <path>` mode reads surfaces via `fetch.from_payload` instead
        of the network, and `--degrade <ep>=<state>` forces a degenerate surface
        via `fetch.degrade`. Both already exist in fetch.py. Without the first,
        STEP 7's "valid input to run_dimensions.py" and STEP 8's no-network control
        are both unsatisfiable, since fetch_all always shells to gh.
        A `--list` mode prints the dimension slugs, discovered by reading
        STEP 4's directory rather than from a hardcoded list. It is named here
        because STEP 4's done-when depends on it, and a deliverable that only
        appears in another step's acceptance criterion is one nobody builds.
        The `document` from contain.render is passed through as the reviewer's
        input verbatim. This module never concatenates surfaces itself, never
        places anything after the closing marker, and never re-calls
        `detect.detect` — contain.render already merges those findings and calling
        it again double-reports.
        done when: before implementing the identity probe, a real CI run (or
        #110's provisioning docs once #119 settles them) has confirmed whether the
        credential `run_dimensions.py` actually receives is a personal token or an
        installation token, and the classification table above is built to match
        whichever it is rather than assuming the personal-token shape — if it is
        an installation token, `GET /user` returning 403 with "Resource not
        accessible by integration" is tested as LIVE-and-proceed, not as
        INFRASTRUCTURE or as PR-not-found; `python3
        launchpad/review-agent/run_dimensions.py <n> --stub`
        against an OPEN pull request exits 0 and prints JSON containing three
        reports, each with status "complete", outcome "clean", and a completion
        marker that `findings.validate` accepts; the PR is open and its `pr_diff`
        surface has state "ok" and non-empty text, asserted rather than assumed —
        a MERGED pull request is not a valid fixture here, because its head is
        already an ancestor of the base so the merge base IS the head and the
        merge-base diff is empty, which passes every SHA assertion below while
        reviewing nothing (measured on PR 86: merge_base_commit.sha equals
        headRefOid, 4434519667afac207f8eeb3950cc5c5de726addd); every report's
        merge_base_sha and head_sha are non-empty and merge_base_sha equals `gh api
        repos/launchpad-26/buzz/compare/{base_sha}...{head_sha} -q
        .merge_base_commit.sha` — by SHA, not by branch name, so the criterion
        survives the head branch being deleted; `--payload` on a captured fixture
        produces the same three reports with the injected runner asserting `gh` was
        never spawned; a 404 PR number under a live credential exits non-zero with a
        reason naming the PR as absent; an invalid credential exits non-zero with a
        DIFFERENT reason naming infrastructure and never names the PR, so the two are
        not one message; and a payload carrying a delimiter_forge yields that finding
        in the top-level `containment.findings` array with its `kind` and
        `entry_point` intact and its evidence byte-identical to the author's text,
        alongside a `containment.states` map of seven keys; and the document carries
        a top-level `nonce` equal to the nonce inside all three completion markers
        and equal to the one `contain.render` wrapped the surfaces with, asserted by
        reading it back out of the rendered document rather than from the variable
        the module already holds — comparing a value to itself proves nothing.

STEP 4  The three dimension definitions, each naming what it must NOT    [needs 1, 3]
        review. Tagged against 3 as well as 1 because its done-when runs
        `run_dimensions.py --list`: the three files can be WRITTEN as soon as
        STEP 1 lands the contract, but the step cannot CLOSE until the runner
        exists. Both facts matter — see PARALLEL, which still fans the writing out.
        One file per dimension under launchpad/review-agent/dimensions/.
        Each states its scope, its exclusions, the severity guidance for its own
        finding classes, and the output contract it emits. Slugs are final because
        finding_id hashes them:
          secrets-and-access — credentials, tokens, keys and passwords in tracked
            files; permission and scope widening in workflows and configs;
            anything granting an agent or job more access than the change needs.
            Grounded in #109's own evidence: a review of a deployment PR found a
            plaintext shared console password in a tracked file, violating that
            folder's own hard rule, while fifteen CI checks were green. Must NOT
            review correctness, style, or whether a claim is supported.
          claim-vs-evidence — assertions in the PR body, commit messages and
            documentation that the diff does not support: a done-criterion marked
            complete with nothing in the diff doing it, a cited file path or issue
            number that does not exist, a quoted figure attributed to a source
            that does not say it, a test named as proof that cannot fail. This is
            the dimension #109's "evidence layer already exists" points at, and
            #122's own corrections are a worked example of the defect class. Must
            NOT review code behaviour, secrets, or anything the PR does not claim.
          correctness-and-failure-modes — what the changed scripts, workflows and
            configs do at their edges: fail-open defaults, an absence rendered as
            a value, a guard narrower than the thing it guards, an error path that
            reports success. Scoped to what this fork actually writes — Python,
            YAML, markdown and shell — not Rust crates or React. Must NOT review
            secrets, unsupported claims, or style.
        The exclusions are load-bearing rather than tidy: the issue's first
        done-criterion is that "a reviewer that reviews everything reviews nothing
        well", and without exclusions all three dimensions converge on the same
        generic review and #118's dedupe absorbs the cost.
        Each definition also states STEP 1's anchoring rule in its own words: a
        defect visible at a line of the diff is reported with anchor "line" and that
        line; anchor "pr" is for a defect with no file and is not a way to avoid
        naming one. Without this in the prompt, the rule lives only in a document the
        reviewer never reads, and anchor "pr" validates for everything.
        done when: three files exist, one per slug; each names both what it
        reviews and what it must not, with the exclusions naming the OTHER TWO
        dimensions' subjects explicitly; each states the finding fields from
        STEP 1 rather than inventing its own; each states the anchoring rule
        including when anchor "pr" is and is not legitimate; none of the three is
        named "containment", which STEP 1 forbids; and `run_dimensions.py --list`
        prints exactly the three slugs, read from the directory rather than
        hardcoded in two places.

STEP 5  The cross-cutting injection clause, in all three definitions.    [needs 4, 8]
        Tagged against 8, not only 4, because its done-when below observes actual
        reviewer output on the two injection fixtures — which STEP 7 creates and
        STEP 8 records. Tagged [needs 4] alone, this step's verification could only
        have been met by inspecting the clause text, which proves nothing about
        detection. Writing the clause needs only STEP 4; proving it needs STEP 8,
        and the weaker tag is what would have let the proof quietly become an
        eyeball check.
        One identical clause in every dimension: author-controlled text attempting
        to act on the review — instructing it to skip, approve, suppress a
        finding, or treat the review as ended — is itself a finding at Blocker,
        per CONTAINMENT.md § Severity contract, with entry_point set to the
        surface it came from.
        This is #117 discharging a debt #120 recorded, not new scope.
        CONTAINMENT.md states detect.py misses 7 of 35 matrix cases — SEMANTIC
        PARAPHRASE, and only that — and that those are #117's responsibility.
        Suppression is NOT among them: `detect._SUPPRESS` catches it, so a fixture
        built from a suppression instruction tests the deterministic layer and not
        this clause. The clause goes in all three definitions rather than one,
        because the issue requires that one dimension failing does not prevent the
        others reporting; if a single dimension owned semantic injection, that
        dimension failing would drop the coverage to zero silently.
        The clause must not be phrased so that a dimension reports the
        DESCRIPTION of an attack. CONTAINMENT.md and this plan both contain
        sentences that look like attacks at the token level — the use-mention
        problem detect.py's docstring documents, and the reason its rule set
        stayed narrow after a broader one produced ten false positives on this
        repository's own issues.
        done when: the clause is byte-identical across all three definition files,
        asserted by a control rather than by eye; the paraphrase fixture satisfies
        `len(detect.detect(fixture_text, ep)) == 0` — asserted FIRST, as a
        precondition on the fixture rather than a property of the result, because a
        fixture the deterministic layer already catches makes this criterion pass
        while proving nothing about the gap, and that is how a fixture silently
        drifts back into the caught set; that same fixture then yields a Blocker
        finding with the right entry_point from each of the three dimensions
        independently; and a fixture containing a DESCRIPTION of such an attack,
        taken verbatim from CONTAINMENT.md itself, yields no injection finding from
        any of them — measured: `detect.detect` returns zero findings against the
        whole of CONTAINMENT.md, so a quotation from it is a valid negative control.

STEP 6  Concurrency and isolation — one dimension failing still reports     [needs 3]
        the others. `concurrent.futures` over the three dimensions, with a
        per-dimension timeout and exception containment: a dimension that raises,
        times out, or returns unparseable output produces status "failed" with a
        reason and does not prevent the other two emitting their reports, nor
        change the process's ability to emit them.
        The exit code is a separate decision from the reports, and this plan fixes
        it: ANY dimension failing exits non-zero while still printing all three
        reports. A run where a dimension crashed is not a clean run, and an exit 0
        is what a CI step reads as "reviewed".
        done when: with a reviewer injected to raise for exactly one dimension,
        stdout carries three reports of which two are complete and one is failed
        with a reason, and the process exits non-zero; with one injected to hang
        past the timeout, the same holds and the run terminates within the timeout
        rather than blocking; and a control asserts the three reviewers were
        actually invoked concurrently rather than serially, by timing a run of
        three deliberately-slow stubs against the single-dimension duration.

STEP 7  Fixture diffs with planted defects — one per dimension.          [needs 1, 3]
        Tagged against 3 for the same reason as STEP 4: its done-when requires each
        fixture be a valid input to run_dimensions.py, which does not exist until
        STEP 3. The fixture FILES can be authored against STEP 1's contract alone.
        Three fixture diffs under launchpad/review-agent/fixtures/dimensions/,
        each carrying one defect its dimension must find and the other two must
        not report, so the fixtures test STEP 4's exclusions and not only
        detection:
          secrets-and-access — a credential in a tracked file. Real precedent
            exists (#109's deployment-PR finding), but the fixture uses an
            OBVIOUSLY FAKE value, never a real or historical credential, and never
            a value copied from any real file. A plausible-looking secret
            committed to a public fork as test data is the defect this dimension
            exists to find.
          claim-vs-evidence — a PR body asserting a done-criterion the diff does
            not satisfy, plus a cited path that does not exist.
          correctness-and-failure-modes — a fail-open default: a check whose
            unreadable input yields a pass. Modelled on the real shape
            run_controls.py guards against, where a missing input must report SKIP
            and never PASS.
        Plus the two injection fixtures STEP 5 requires, and each is pinned to a
        named entry_point rather than left to float:
          the paraphrase fixture — one paraphrased attack from the 7 missed
            classes — semantic paraphrase, NOT a suppression instruction, which
            detect.py catches — planted in the `pr_diff` surface, embedded in a
            code comment at a specific new-side line. `pr_diff` because it is the
            one entry_point where a location is native to the surface — it is a
            unified diff carrying `+++ b/path` headers and hunk ranges, the same
            structure the three defect fixtures below are already anchored
            against — so the resulting finding can and must carry anchor "line"
            exactly as those three do, rather than falling back to "pr" for lack
            of anywhere to point.
          the description-of-an-attack fixture — quoted verbatim from
            CONTAINMENT.md — planted in the `pr_body` surface, as prose describing
            an attack rather than code carrying one. `pr_body` because it is the
            natural home for descriptive prose, and because pinning it to a
            different surface than the paraphrase fixture keeps the two fixtures
            from being confused with each other when a control iterates entry
            points.
        Each fixture's header comment records the LOCATION its defect is planted
        at: the repo-relative path and the NEW-SIDE line number, at head_sha. This
        now applies to FOUR of the five fixtures, not three: the three defect
        fixtures below, AND the paraphrase fixture, whose resulting finding is a
        ten-field dimension record with its own anchor field — not a raw
        contain.Finding, which has no file or line at all — and so can validate
        with anchor "pr" and no location unless a recorded planted location exists
        to check it against. That is exactly the defect class the anchor control
        exists to prevent, and it is most load-bearing here of all four fixtures:
        semantic paraphrase is the one gap CONTAINMENT.md hands to #117 by name,
        so an unanchored finding on this fixture specifically would let the one
        thing this issue exists to catch pass validation while naming no location.
        The fifth fixture — description-of-an-attack — is the exception, and
        deliberately so: it must produce NO finding from any dimension, so it has
        no location to record. Its header states that explicitly (no planted
        location, because none should ever be needed) rather than omitting the
        field silently, so a reader cannot mistake the absence for an oversight.
        Without a recorded location on the four fixtures that need one, there is
        nothing to compare a finding's file and line against, and "the dimension
        found it" degrades to "the dimension said something", which anchor "pr"
        satisfies for free.
        done when: five fixtures exist; each parses as a diff or as a Surface
        payload `fetch.from_payload` accepts; each of the three defect fixtures
        AND the paraphrase fixture is a valid input to run_dimensions.py; each of
        those four names, in a header comment, its planted entry_point, the
        dimension(s) that must find it and, for the three defect fixtures, the two
        that must not, AND the path and new-side line its defect sits at; the
        description-of-an-attack fixture's header instead states its planted
        entry_point (`pr_body`) and that no location is recorded because none
        should ever be needed; and the paraphrase fixture satisfies
        `len(detect.detect(text, ep)) == 0` per STEP 5.

STEP 8  Recorded reviewer outputs for the deterministic suite.        [needs 3, 4, 7]
        Tagged against 3 and 4, not only 7: a recording is the output of a real
        model run, which needs STEP 4's prompt to run and STEP 3's runner to invoke
        it. PARALLEL said as much in prose — "depends on STEP 7's fixtures and on a
        working runner" — while the tag named only the fixtures.
        For each fixture, a recorded reviewer output per dimension, stored as JSON
        and replayed by the injected reviewer. Recorded from a real run against a
        real model and NEVER hand-written — a hand-written "model output" tests
        only that the author can write valid JSON, which STEP 2's validator
        already covers.
        The model used and the date are recorded in each file. That is provenance,
        not a model choice: #117 puts choosing the model out of scope, and the
        runner still never names one.
        Each recording's nonce is SEED-DERIVED, via `contain.make_nonce(seed)` with
        the seed recorded beside the model id. A committed fixture carrying a nonce
        copied from a live run is a per-run value published in a public repository
        that reads like a production one, and CONTAINMENT.md reserves the seed flag
        for exactly this.
        done when: fifteen recordings exist (five fixtures x three dimensions);
        each carries a seed-derived nonce and the seed that produced it;
        each is valid against `findings.validate`; each carries the model id and
        date it was recorded; a control asserts the replay path makes no network
        call, by injecting a runner that raises if the real `gh` binary or any HTTP
        client is invoked; and the recordings show each defect fixture found by its
        own dimension and not reported by the other two, WITH the finding anchored at
        the path and new-side line STEP 7's header records — a finding that names the
        defect but anchors it at "pr" does not satisfy this criterion, because
        #117's done-criterion is severity plus file:line and anchor "pr" carries
        neither field. THE SAME anchor requirement applies to the paraphrase
        fixture's three recordings (one per dimension): each carries the Blocker
        finding STEP 5 requires, anchored at the `pr_diff` path and new-side line
        STEP 7's header records for it, not at "pr" — recorded here, not only in
        STEP 9's control, because a recording built to satisfy STEP 5's done-when
        alone (entry_point correct, anchor unchecked) is exactly what would make
        STEP 9's later anchor control fail against evidence that should never have
        been recorded that way; and the description-of-an-attack fixture's three
        recordings carry no injection finding from any dimension, matching STEP 7's
        header note that it has no location to anchor.

STEP 9  The control suite — one control per done-criterion.           [needs 5, 6, 8]
        Tagged against 5 because two of its controls below read the injection
        clause STEP 5 writes — one of them names STEP 5 in its own text. The
        earlier [needs 6, 8] tag reached 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 transitively but never 5.
        launchpad/review-agent/check_dimensions.py, registered in
        run_controls.py's CONTROLS list as (check_dimensions.py, False) so #120's
        single CI entry point picks it up and no second workflow is added. One
        control per #117 done-criterion, plus:
          a truncated report — completion marker removed — read as truncated and
            never as clean, asserted for each of the three dimensions
          a marker present but carrying the WRONG NONCE, rejected — the wrong nonce
            being one that differs from the merged document's top-level `nonce`, not
            "another dimension's", since one nonce serves the whole run. The control
            feeds a nonce lifted from a fixture's diff, which is the real shape of
            this attack: a reviewer echoing a marker the author wrote
          the merged document's `nonce` present and equal to the nonce inside all
            three markers; and a document where exactly ONE report's marker nonce
            differs is rejected while the validator still names the other two as
            valid, so a single echoed marker does not discard two good reports
          outcome "clean" distinguished from status "failed" in both directions:
            neither is ever read as the other
          findings_count disagreeing with len(findings), rejected
          for each of the TEN finding fields, a control feeding it empty, missing
            and malformed in turn, asserting `validate` names it — ten is a list
            someone can count, "every field" is not. The count is checked against
            STEP 1's list rather than trusted: the first revision declared nine
            while the conversion mapped a tenth, and a per-field suite silently
            skips a field that is not in the list it iterates
          outcome cross-checked against the findings array in BOTH directions:
            outcome "clean" carrying a finding is rejected, and outcome "findings"
            with an empty array is rejected. The first of the two is the dangerous
            one — a real Blocker published under the word "clean" — and it passed
            every other rule in the first revision
          the byte-identical injection clause across the three definitions
          the injection clause's BEHAVIOUR, not only its text: replaying STEP 8's
            recordings for the paraphrased-attack fixture yields a Blocker finding
            with the right entry_point from each of the three dimensions, and the
            description-of-an-attack fixture yields none from any of them. STEP 5's
            done-when proves this once at build time; without a control here it is
            never re-checked, and byte-identity of the clause text is not evidence
            the clause works
          a containment TRANSPORT control: a payload carrying each of
            delimiter_forge, delimiter_lookalike and injection_attempt puts that
            finding in the top-level `containment.findings` array with its
            `severity` Blocker, its `kind`, its `entry_point`, and its `evidence`
            BYTE-IDENTICAL to the author's text — asserted for all three kinds,
            since a transport that handles one and drops two reads as working, and
            asserted on entry_point specifically, because a Blocker naming no
            surface is the detected-then-dropped case wearing a full record
          `containment.states` carries all SEVEN entry points — the control counts
            the keys and compares the set to contain.ENTRY_POINTS, rather than
            checking the key exists. A six-key map silences #119's incomplete
            banner, and that failure is invisible from inside #117
          `containment` is present on a run with no containment findings, as an
            EMPTY findings array plus a full states map — never a missing key, which
            #119 reads as an incomplete review
          no dimension slug is "containment", and no dimension report's findings
            array carries a finding with a `kind` field
          the anchor control, against STEP 7's recorded locations: for each of the
            three defect fixtures, the own-dimension finding in STEP 8's recording
            carries anchor "line" with the path and new-side line the fixture header
            names. This is the control that stops anchor "pr" being a way to satisfy
            every other criterion while naming no location at all
          the SAME anchor control, extended to the paraphrase fixture: for each of
            the three dimensions' recordings against it, the Blocker finding STEP
            5 requires carries anchor "line" with the `pr_diff` path and new-side
            line STEP 7's header records for it — not anchor "pr". Named
            separately from the bullet above because this fixture is not one of
            "the three defect fixtures" and an anchor control scoped to that phrase
            alone would silently exclude it, letting the one entry_point unique to
            #117's own responsibility — semantic paraphrase — validate with no
            location while every other criterion in this plan passes. The
            description-of-an-attack fixture has no equivalent control here: it
            must produce no finding at all, so there is no anchor to check, and
            that absence is asserted by the behavioural control above, not by this
            one
        done when: `python3 launchpad/review-agent/check_dimensions.py` passes; it
        is listed in run_controls.py; `python3
        launchpad/review-agent/run_controls.py` runs it and reports it in the
        summary; the suite makes no network call, asserted by the injected runner
        above; and each bullet above has a separately named control.

STEP 10 Live prompt-mutation evidence — one run per dimension, pasted.      [needs 9]
        The falsifiability criterion, answered the way it was decided: for each
        dimension, delete the clause of its definition that targets its planted
        defect, run it live against its fixture, and record that the defect is no
        longer found — then restore and record that it is. Raw before-and-after
        output pasted into the PR body.
        This is the half that is NOT deterministic, and the PR body must say so.
        It is a one-off measurement with a named model on a named date, not a
        gate. A single run of a non-deterministic reviewer is one sample; a
        dimension that finds its defect once has not been shown to find it
        reliably. Stating the sample size is the difference between evidence and a
        claim.
        done when: three before/after pairs are pasted raw into the PR body; each
        names the model, the date, and the exact clause removed; each shows the
        planted defect found with the clause and absent without it; and the PR
        body states in its own words that this is a single non-deterministic
        sample per dimension and that the deterministic gate is STEP 9.

STEP 11 Prove each control can fail. For every check function in STEP 9,    [needs 9]
        neuter it to a constant and confirm the suite goes red. A control never
        observed failing has not been shown to test anything, and this is the
        criterion most likely to be quietly downgraded to "the suite passes".
        done when: a recorded run shows, for each check function, the suite
        failing while that function is neutered and passing when restored, with
        the raw output pasted into the PR body.

STEP 12 Open the PR against launchpad — AGENT_PR_TEMPLATE.md filled,   [needs 10, 11]
        `Closes #117`, `by:agent`, all raw output from STEPs 10 and 11 pasted, and
        Escalations naming every deferral in OPEN below — above all the dependency
        on #120's uncommitted tree and the fact that the findings contract is
        settled unilaterally here for #118 to honour.
        done when: the PR is open against launchpad with the by:agent label; the
        "launchpad — PR body check" check is green; every commit carries a
        Signed-off-by trailer so the DCO check passes; and the body names both the
        #120 ordering dependency and the #118 contract hand-off explicitly.

PARALLEL  Two genuine fan-outs, and one that looks available but is not.
  STEP 4's three definitions are three disjoint files and can be WRITTEN as three
  parallel subagents once STEP 1 has landed the contract. That is the one place
  the work is naturally three-way, and it is the reason STEP 4's subagents must
  not each invent their own phrasing of the injection clause — STEP 5 later
  requires all three to be byte-identical.
  Writing is not closing. STEP 4 is tagged [needs 1, 3] because its done-when runs
  `run_dimensions.py --list`, so the fan-out produces three files that sit
  unverified until STEP 3 exists. Dispatch them early if it suits the schedule, but
  do not mark the step done on the strength of three files having been written —
  that is the failure this plan already made once, in STEP 5.
  STEP 7's five fixtures are disjoint files and can be authored in parallel with
  STEP 4, since fixtures and definitions do not touch each other. Same caveat: it
  is tagged [needs 1, 3] and closes only once the runner can accept them.
  STEP 5 does not sit where its number suggests. It edits all three definition
  files, so it cannot join STEP 4's fan-out, and it is tagged [needs 4, 8] because
  its verification observes real reviewer output. In execution order it lands after
  STEP 8, alongside STEP 6 rather than before it. The numbering is left as-is
  because renumbering would break every cross-reference in this plan; the tags,
  not the numbers, are the dependency graph.
  STEPs 2, 3 and 6 cannot be parallelised, though 6 looks independent of 2.
  STEP 6 edits run_dimensions.py, which STEP 3 creates; two steps editing one file
  are sequential regardless of how unrelated they look. STEP 8 depends on STEP 7's
  fixtures and on a working runner, so it cannot start early either.
  STEPs 9 through 12 are strictly sequential — each reads the whole surface the
  previous produced. STEP 1 is the only step independent as written. Nothing is
  dispatched here; the decision to fan out belongs to whoever executes this.

GATES  No verify gate is installed in this checkout — .claude/settings.json is
  absent — so every gate is a manual invocation and none will fire on its own.
  serina:review-plan has run ONCE on this file, before STEP 1, and this revision
  is the result. Five findings, all applied, none disputed — one Blocker: STEP 3's
  done-when required a merge-base SHA, a head SHA and a distinguishable 404, and
  none of the three is obtainable from the two calls it named, because fetch.py
  discards the SHAs and `_gh` collapses every failure into one `absent` state.
  Two High: contain.render's second return value — the deterministic 21-of-35
  catches — was computed and then consumed by nobody, despite STEP 1 defining
  `entry_point` expressly to carry it; and STEP 5's behavioural done-when was
  tagged [needs 4] when it needs STEP 8's recordings, with STEP 9 checking only
  the clause's byte-identity, so the one mechanism CONTAINMENT.md hands #117 by
  name had no durable control. Two Low: an envelope field miscount, and a wrong
  line citation for SEVERITY_ORDER.
  On that last one the reviewer was also wrong — it proposed review.py:19 against
  this plan's review.py:20, and `grep -n` puts it at review.py:32. The plan now
  says 32. Recorded because a correction accepted without checking is how a wrong
  number launders itself into looking verified.
  serina:review-plan has now run TWICE, and this revision is the result of both.
  The second pass returned SEVEN findings and, as on #116, nearly all of them were
  against the first pass's own fixes rather than the original plan — which is the
  argument for the second pass, not a footnote to it.
  Second pass, one Blocker: STEP 1's containment conversion mapped an `evidence`
  value into a record that declared only nine fields and had no such field, so the
  escaped excerpt would either be dropped — the detected-then-dropped case
  CONTAINMENT.md calls worse than never detecting — or become an undeclared tenth
  field that STEP 9's per-field suite would never exercise. `evidence` is now
  declared, required whenever `entry_point` is set, and the count is ten.
  Four High. FOUR MORE STEPS carried the exact defect the first pass fixed in
  STEP 5 — a done-when observing something its own tags cannot produce: STEP 4 and
  STEP 7 both call `run_dimensions.py` while tagged [needs 1], STEP 8 needed the
  runner and the prompts while tagged [needs 7], and STEP 9 named STEP 5 in its own
  control text while tagged [needs 6, 8]. All four retagged. `--list` was also
  promised only inside STEP 4's acceptance criterion and is now a named STEP 3
  deliverable. Separately, `findings.validate` never cross-checked `outcome`
  against the findings array, so a report reading outcome "clean" while carrying a
  real Blocker passed every other rule — a fail-open in the dangerous direction,
  now a validation rule and a two-directional control. And STEP 3's 404 handling
  still conflated a missing PR with one the credential cannot see, because GitHub
  returns 404 rather than 403 for no-access; it now probes the repo and classifies
  three states, with the residual case named in OPEN.
  One Medium and one Low, both accepted: the pr_diff anchor loss is now recorded in
  OPEN rather than left implicit, and the drifting line citations are replaced by
  symbol names — contain.py had moved under this plan's feet between the two
  passes, which is itself the clearest evidence for BUDGET's warning.
  serina:review-plan has now run THREE times, and this revision is the result of
  all three. The third pass returned ELEVEN findings — three Blocker, three High,
  four Medium, plus one found while persisting the record — and its verified
  evidence is at launchpad/plans/reviews/2026-08-13-117-plan-review.md. As on the
  second pass, most were against the earlier passes' own fixes.
  Third pass, three Blockers, all fixed here. The contain.Finding conversion never
  mapped `entry_point`, and because both it and `evidence` were declared optional a
  converter could drop the pair and pass every rule — a published Blocker naming no
  surface, no excerpt and no location. `finding_id` excluded `entry_point` and
  `evidence`, so containment findings of one kind collapsed to a single id;
  demonstrated with two delimiter_lookalike findings from one entry point hashing
  identically, where contain._dedupe deliberately keeps them apart. And STEP 3's
  repo probe could not do the job claimed for it: launchpad-26/buzz is PUBLIC, so
  the repo endpoint answers 200 to a caller with no credential at all.
  On that last one the reviewer's severity was too high and it said so. The probe's
  real defect is that it discriminates nothing rather than that it misclassifies a
  dead token: an invalid token returns "Bad credentials" on the PR endpoint itself,
  so infrastructure was already caught. The fix stands on its own merits — an
  identity probe makes the discrimination explicit and correct rather than
  incidental — but it was a Medium wearing a Blocker's severity, and the record says
  so rather than letting the fix launder the rating.
  Three High, all fixed. The detection counts were stale — 28 of 35 caught and 7
  missed, not 21 and 14 — and STEP 5's fixture was specified from a class detect.py
  now catches, so the one gap CONTAINMENT.md hands #117 by name had a control that
  could pass without testing it. Where containment findings lived was ambiguous
  between a fourth envelope and a merge into the dimension reports, and #118 parses
  that shape. And no done-when anywhere required a planted defect to be reported at
  the line it was planted at, so anchor "pr" satisfied every criterion while naming
  no location.
  Four Medium, all fixed: a 401 matched two classification branches with no
  tie-break; #120's tree is committed but unmerged and was described as optional
  sequencing when five steps require it; STEP 3's acceptance PR was MERGED, so its
  merge-base diff is empty and the run reviewed nothing; and `evidence` was declared
  post-escape against a renderer that escapes at render time.
  The eleventh finding is why OPEN now names #119: it was already built against
  revision 3 of this contract and earlier revisions of this plan did not say so.
  This revision is once-reviewed at the margin in the same way its predecessors
  were: the third pass's own fixes have not been reviewed, and the settlement in
  One change here came from #119's review, not from any pass on this plan. #119's
  first review found that its STEP 5 condition "a report's completion_marker carries
  the wrong dimension or nonce" could not be implemented, because the nonce reached
  it only inside the marker string it was meant to check. That is a defect in THIS
  contract, surfaced by a review of a different issue, and the merged document now
  carries a top-level `nonce`. Recorded here because the finding's provenance
  matters: three passes on this plan did not find it, and the stage that had to
  consume the contract did. Two overclaims were avoided in fixing it — the nonce is
  one per RUN, so "another dimension's nonce" is not an input this contract can
  produce and a check written that way tests nothing; and the key authenticates a
  marker echoed out of author text, NOT the document, which anyone fabricating the
  whole document sets consistently. The nonce is on the merged document only, not on
  the per-report envelope, which stays eleven fields.
  STEP 1 is a decision rather than a correction. A fourth pass is available and was
  not run.
  Then serina:review-code and serina:review-tests after STEP 11, then
  serina:review-adjudicate, then serina:review-final — all BEFORE the push in
  STEP 12, because a review posted after the push only documents what already
  shipped.
  A clean check-plan.sh run is mechanical only. It verifies the single run-marker,
  the step count, a done-when per step, a dependency tag per step, and the six
  named sections. It judges nothing about whether the steps are right, and it
  cannot tell you a step is already done.

BUDGET  STEP 8 eats the budget, and STEP 3 decides how badly — but the thing most
  likely to derail this issue is neither.
  STEP 3 grew after review and is now the second-largest step, not the thin shell
  it started as. It owns the commit-pair resolution, the 404-versus-outage
  distinction, the contain.Finding conversion and two offline modes, on top of the
  concurrent dispatch. Each was added because a done-when elsewhere depended on it
  and nothing provided it. If STEP 3 is built to its original one-line description
  — two calls and a print — STEPs 6, 7, 8 and 9 all fail their own criteria and the
  cost lands there instead, which is the more expensive place to pay it.
  #120's tree is committed but UNMERGED, and its landing first is a precondition
  rather than a mitigation. Every module #117 imports — contain.render,
  fetch.fetch_all, fetch.Surface, review.SEVERITY_ORDER — now exists in three
  pushed commits on `feat/review-agent-untrusted-input`, and in NO tree reachable
  from this branch: `launchpad/review-agent/` does not exist here, and
  origin/launchpad is 0 commits behind that branch's 3. So STEP 2 cannot `import
  review`, and STEP 9 cannot append to a `run_controls.py` that is not present.
  Earlier revisions called ordering "the cheapest mitigation" and a fleet decision;
  that was wrong, because five steps cannot start without it. The precondition is
  discharged by #120 merging to launchpad and this branch rebasing — never by
  copying those files here, which creates the second source of truth LEFT OUT
  forbids. Note that STEP 2's first acceptance check was `py_compile`, which
  compiles a module without resolving its imports and so passes on a findings.py
  whose `import review` cannot be satisfied; it is now `python3 -c "import
  findings"`, which fails for the right reason. Once the precondition holds, the
  residual risk is a rebase moving line numbers: before STEP 2, re-verify
  contain.render's signature and Surface's fields against what #120 has committed by
  then rather than trusting the numbers in ALREADY TRUE. That instruction has now
  paid for itself twice — it caught the 28-of-35 count change and the suppression
  rule, both of which had silently invalidated STEP 5's fixture specification.
  STEP 8 is fifteen recordings, each needing a real run against a real model, and
  it is the step where "recorded from a real run" quietly becomes "hand-written to
  look like one". A hand-written recording tests nothing STEP 2's validator does
  not already cover, and the failure is invisible from inside the suite, which
  passes either way.
  STEP 3 decides STEP 8's cost. If the reviewer is not an injected callable — if a
  model call is hardcoded at its call site — then STEP 8 stops being recording and
  becomes a rewrite of STEPs 3 and 6.

OPEN  Not for a builder to decide.
  The findings contract is settled here unilaterally, and it now has TWO consumers,
  not one. #117's issue says it is "agreed in whichever of the two lands first,
  then honoured by the other", and this plan takes that mandate. #118 may still
  object, and if it does the field names in STEP 1 change and STEPs 2, 8 and 9
  change with them. Whether the contract should instead be agreed in a comment on
  #118 before STEP 1 is built is a sequencing call.
  #119 WAS BUILT AGAINST AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS CONTRACT, and that is now
  RESOLVED rather than open. `launchpad/plans/2026-08-12-issue-119-publish-one-review.md`
  on `feat/review-agent-publish` enumerated this contract's field names explicitly,
  marked them PROVISIONAL, and recorded in its own OPEN that "#117 must add one key
  to its output before #119 can publish a containment finding" — the sibling-key
  and nonce gaps STEP 1's CONTRACT CHANGES list still names. That branch has since
  reconciled: commit `01169c8a3` ("consume #117's run nonce instead of inferring
  it") updates #119's STEP 5 and STEP 7 to read the merged document's top-level
  `nonce` key rather than inferring it, drops the "another dimension's nonce"
  fixture this contract cannot produce, and records the limit that the key
  authenticates an echoed marker and not the whole document — matching STEP 1 and
  the six-point change list here exactly. Nothing here edited #119's plan; the
  reconciliation was done by whoever owns it, and this note is not a fourth
  passing pass on that plan. If #119 drifts again — a rebase, a further review
  pass — recheck `git log origin/feat/review-agent-publish` before trusting this
  paragraph, per the same citation-rot warning ALREADY TRUE gives for line numbers
  and hashes.
  Whether the pre-flight record is an input to the dimensions at all. #116's plan
  has the record enumerated but NOT BUILT — its branch carries only the plan file.
  This plan therefore has the runner call fetch and contain directly rather than
  consuming #116's record, which means the merge-base SHA pair is resolved twice
  by two stages. Whether #117 should instead wait on #116 and consume its record
  is a real design choice with a real cost either way, and #116's own OPEN section
  leaves the record's schema version undecided — a version the dimensions would
  need in order to depend on its shape.
  #118's issue body still carries the wording #122 corrected, as recorded in
  ALREADY TRUE. #109 was amended; #118 was not. Amending it is a one-comment fix
  and belongs to whoever owns #118, not to this issue.
  Three dimensions and their slugs were answered, not derived. A reviewer may
  judge that this fork's diffs want a different split — for instance that
  claim-vs-evidence and correctness-and-failure-modes overlap on a test that
  cannot fail, which is both an unsupported claim and a fail-open control. The
  slugs are hashed into finding_id, so changing one after STEP 8 invalidates the
  recordings.
  Where the dimensions run is #110's decision and is already made — GitHub
  Actions, with a token scoped to launchpad-26/buzz. No new workflow file is added
  by this work: #120 already added
  .github/workflows/launchpad-review-agent-controls.yml and the dimension controls
  register into its runner. Whether that file should be split per issue is for
  whoever reviews #120.
  The per-dimension timeout in STEP 6 has no principled value yet. No dimension
  has been run against a real diff, so any number is a guess. It is written as a
  flag with a stated default and a note that the default is unmeasured.
  Containment findings from `pr_diff` lose a location that is arguably derivable.
  A contain.Finding has no file and no line field at all, and STEP 1 now carries
  them raw rather than converting them, so there is no anchor on them to be wrong —
  but the loss is the same. For six of the seven entry points it is simply the
  truth. For `pr_diff` it is a real loss rather than an honest absence: the surface
  text is a unified diff carrying `+++ b/path` headers and hunk ranges, so an
  injection attempt embedded in the code itself does have a location — it is just
  not extracted. Deriving it would mean mapping an excerpt offset back through
  contain.py's escaping to a hunk, which is more than #117 was asked for, and
  guessing it would be the false precision the anchor rule exists to prevent.
  Recorded here as a named loss rather than left to look like a considered absence.
  Whoever wants line-anchored injection findings in the diff should file it against
  #120, since the field would have to be added to contain.Finding.
  A live credential blocked from one specific pull request. STEP 3's identity probe
  separates a dead credential from an absent PR cleanly, and on a PUBLIC repo a
  404 under a live credential is genuinely absence. What it does not cover is a
  live credential that can read the repo but is blocked from one pull request, which
  returns 403 and is given its own reason string rather than being folded into
  infrastructure. Whether that 403 branch needs a further probe — and what happens
  if launchpad-26/buzz is ever made private, where 404 becomes ambiguous again — is
  a judgement about how the Actions credential in #110 can actually fail, which
  needs #119's provisioning to be settled first.

LEFT OUT  Deliberately excluded.
  Deciding whether a finding is real — confirm/refute, re-rated severity, dedupe,
  the total-refutation flag. #117 puts it out of scope and #118 owns it. These
  dimensions emit candidates and nothing more.
  Publishing to the PR. `review.render_review` exists and #119 owns publication.
  This runner prints JSON to stdout and posts nothing.
  Choosing the model. Out of scope per #117. The runner takes an injected reviewer
  and never names a model; STEP 8's recordings carry a model id as provenance for
  a measurement already taken, which is not the same as choosing one.
  Any approval weight. Phase 1 is escalate-only. #109's reasoning for that
  survives #122's corrections: a judge validated on static held-out material can
  still be near-chance on adversarial material, so a pilot on ordinary PRs would
  not reveal the failure. The confirmed figure is that judges perform "on average
  only slightly better than a random coin-flip" against 6,642 human-verified
  labels; the AUROC 0.48-0.64 range is one judge on one victim model under two
  attacks and is not quoted here as anything broader.
  The 28 of 35 attack classes detect.py already catches — which now includes
  suppression, per the `detect._SUPPRESS` commit named in ALREADY TRUE (check
  the current HEAD of feat/review-agent-untrusted-input, not a pinned hash).
  Duplicating deterministic detection in a model prompt
  costs tokens and adds a second source of truth. #117 takes the 7 it was handed,
  all of them semantic paraphrase.
  Measuring the dimensions' precision and recall. #121 owns the first ten reviews
  and #109's success signals. STEP 10 produces one sample per dimension, which is
  provenance for the falsifiability criterion and explicitly not a rate.
  Accessibility is out of scope for this issue and is not claimed. The deliverable
  is definitions plus a CLI printing JSON to stdout — no UI, no interactive
  control, nothing to announce, no focus to manage. When #119 renders findings
  into a PR comment, that surface is markdown read by GitHub's own interface; if a
  rendered dashboard ever follows, it needs its own keyboard and announcement
  specification and does not inherit one from here.
